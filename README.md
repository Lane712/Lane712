# About me

- 👀 I'm fascinated by the world of technology, creativity, and design, especially when it comes to building beautiful websites, apps, games, and more. I'm always eager to learn new things and turn my ideas into reality through code and creativity.

- 🌱 I'm currently diving into Python, web development, Android development, Ren'Py, and Tyrano Script. Though it has taken a long time, I'm still new to these tools.

- 💞️ Although I'm still in the learning phase and not yet ready to contribute to projects, I'm eager to connect with experienced developers to learn from their insights and experiences. I also hope to meet fellow beginners to share our progress, challenges, and support each other on this journey. In the future, I aspire to collaborate on small projects like simple app development, interactive story creation, or basic web design.

- 📫 You can reach me through my GitHub profile or send me an email at [Lnaqis](lnaqis@outlook.com). I'm always excited to meet like-minded people!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once spent a weekend trying to write a simple number-guessing game in Python. The code was short, but seeing it work gave me such a huge sense of accomplishment!
